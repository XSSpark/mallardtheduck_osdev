 *
 * My go at writing a simple string class.
 *
 * You can probably replace std::string with this one in many
 * cases, but a lot of stuff is missing, and I would recommend
 * you stick to std::string anyway.
 *
 * I want to point out that there is nothing fancy about this class.
 * It keeps every string in its own buffer, and copies as often as
 * needed.
 *
 * However, I believe that is a good approach.  For instance, it
 * uses malloc rather than new, which makes it possible to use
 * realloc.  On many systems, realloc will try to use up "invisible"
 * space that was used by malloc to pad a string for memory alignment.
 * That makes it potentially fast for small concatenations.
 *
 * I don't propose to use this class for anything practical, since
 * we already have std::string, but it may be an interesting read
 * for C++ novices at the very least.
 *
 * If you're actually going to use this, at least inline c_str(),
 * empty(), size() and operator[], or even all of the one-line
 * functions.
 *
 * Please send bug reports and suggestions to <csl@sublevel3.org>
 *
